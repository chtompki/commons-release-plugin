*** THESE ITEMS REQUIRE YOUR ATTENTION ***
To: dev@commons.apache.org
Subject: [VOTE] Release @NAME@ @VERSION@ based on @RC@

We have fixed quite a few bugs and added some significant enhancements since @NAME@ @BC@ was released, so I would like to release @NAME@ @VERSION@.

@NAME@ @VERSION@ @RC@ is available for review here:
    @DISTURL@ (svn revision @RCREV@)

*** Does your project use Subversion or Git ? ***
*** Subversion: ***
The Subversion tag for this RC is here:
    http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/@ID@/tags/@ARTIFACTID@-@VERSION@-@RC@/ (svn revision XYZ2)
    N.B. the SVN revision is required because SVN tags are not immutable.
*** Git: ***    
The Git tag @TAGNAME@ commit for this RC is @TAGCOMMIT@ which you can browse here:
    https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=commons-@ID@.git;a=tag;h=refs/tags/@TAGNAME@

Maven artifacts are here:
    https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapachecommons-***NNNN***/org/apache/commons/@ARTIFACTID@/@VERSION@/

These are the Maven artifacts and their hashes in Nexus:

@SHA1LIST@
@SHA256LIST@

(no need for .asc hashes!)

I have tested this with ***'mvn clean install site'*** using: 
***
Use the output from "mvn -version" for each combination you tested.

Details of changes since @BC@ are in the release notes:
    https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/commons/@ID@/@VERSION@-@RC@/RELEASE-NOTES.txt
    @SITEURL@/changes-report.html

Site:
    @SITEURL@
    (note some *relative* links are broken and the @VERSION@ directories are not yet created - these will be OK once the site is deployed.)

CLIRR Report (compared to @BC@):
    @SITEURL@/clirr-report.html

JApiCmp Report (compared to @BC@):
    @SITEURL@/japicmp.html
    
    ***
    Note that Clirr reports several errors.
    These are considered OK for the reasons stated below.
    These exceptions are also noted in the Changes and Release Notes.

    Errors reported:
    - methods added to interface: OK because that does not affect binary compatibility.
    - etc.
    ***
    
RAT Report:
    @SITEURL@/rat-report.html

Please review the release candidate and vote.
This vote will close no sooner that 72 hours from now.
